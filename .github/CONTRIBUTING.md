Contributing to Berry can be done in many ways, also in more than 'just' code. Available options you can consider are:

- Implement a feature or fix a bug

## Implement a feature or fix a bug

Implementing a feature or fixing bugs can be done via "Pull-Requests". Doing that is really easy. If you are new to open source, feel free to check out one of the following resources:

- https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/
- https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

If you are new to our project and first want to get comfortable with contributing, feel free to check out the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/PurotoApp/Berry/labels/good%20first%20issue). They're features and bugs, that should be easily implemented or fixed. A good way to get started!

If you are already experienced in open source development, feel free to check out or open issues and feature request. If you have a brilliant idea for a new feature that great! Just please [open an issue](#Creating issues) with an explanation of what you are going to implement first to discuss with our staff how the feature should be implemented to enhance the project. Don't forget to add the issue to your PR later on!
